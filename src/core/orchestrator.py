"""
Module: orchestrator.py
Purpose: Sequence the per-item pipeline (drive -> vision -> pricing -> assemble ->
         publish), own per-item state, and flush AI context between items.
Primary Responsibilities:
  - For each pending batch/item: fetch images, extract, price, assemble the
    ListingPayload, and record every step in the state store.
  - Dedup already-published SKUs and resume after interruption (R-STATE).
  - Flush Gemini context after each item to avoid token bloat (PI-003).
  - Isolate a single batch's failure (a Gemini JSON parse ValueError, a
    DriveFetchError, or any other Exception raised while preparing one batch)
    so it can never abort the rest of the scan; the failing batch is recorded
    ItemStatus.ERROR with a truncated human-readable reason and the scan
    continues with the next batch (see ScanSummary / _prepare_one_batch).
  - After a successful auto-publish, archive the source Drive batch
    (drive_fetcher.archive_batch) so it is not re-listed by future scans;
    archive failures are logged but never fail or roll back the publish.
  - Provide the headless entry point (`python -m src.core.orchestrator`) that the
    Streamlit UI and a CLI run both share; main() never lets an exception
    escape as a raw traceback (PI-001's "never a raw traceback" contract
    applies at this boundary too).
Key Interfaces:
  - Input: drive_fetcher batches, AIProvider, StateStore, ebay_client.
  - Output: per-item ItemRecord updates; a ScanSummary (payloads + per-batch
    errors + stale-cache flag) for the UI; PublishResult after an approved
    publish.
FMEA Constraints Enforced:
  - PI-003 — context flushed per item (the provider is stateless per call).
  - R-STATE — dedup + resume via the state store; IDs written right after publish.
  - PI-007 — the orchestrator never auto-publishes; publish_approved is only
    called after an explicit human Approve in the UI.
  - PI-001 — archive_batch is wrapped so a Drive-side archive failure is a
    best-effort/logged event, never a publish failure (the state store's
    dedup guard is the durable safeguard against re-processing either way).
    The same "never a raw traceback" contract is honored for per-batch
    failures in scan_and_prepare and for main()'s top-level flow.

        state store's is_published() dedup guard already covers it. The
