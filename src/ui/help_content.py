"""
Module: help_content.py
Purpose: Streamlit-free source of truth for the in-app tip sheet — contextual
         widget hints (TIPS) and the "Help" tab's static content (HELP_SECTIONS)
         — so operator-facing guidance text is testable and never hand-duplicated
         between the UI and its tests.
Primary Responsibilities:
  - Hold every contextual hint string (TIPS), keyed by the widget/location it is
    attached to in src/ui/app.py via each widget's help= parameter (or appended
    to an st.error/st.warning message where help= is not applicable).
  - Hold the Help tab's full content (HELP_SECTIONS): ordered (heading, markdown
    body) pairs covering what the app does, setup, the workflow, error/warning
    meanings, where data lives, platform coverage, and safety notes.
  - Reuse src.core.settings.PORTAL_LINKS for the Facebook Marketplace / Mercari
    posting links rather than hardcoding those URLs a second time here.
Key Interfaces:
  - Input: None (all content is static; PORTAL_LINKS is imported, not computed).
  - Output: TIPS (dict[str, str]) and HELP_SECTIONS (list[tuple[str, str]]),
    consumed by src/ui/app.py's widget help= arguments and the Help tab renderer.
FMEA Constraints Enforced:
  - PI-004 — "description_editor" and the Safety notes section both state that
    defect disclosure is confirmed by the operator before Approve, matching the
    contract's forced defects_found field and orchestrator's description build.
  - PI-007 — "approve_button" and the workflow section both state that eBay
    publishes live immediately while FB/Mercari only ever write a local draft,
    matching src/marketplace/other_adapter.py's DRAFT_ONLY capability.
  - PI-014 — "manual_packet", "manual_reply", and the "Manual AI mode" section
    state that the packet ID must come back in the reply, that a wrong-item
    reply is refused, and that the check covers the pasted reply rather than
    the attached photos (T-027).

NOTE: this module must NEVER import streamlit — it is imported by tests that do
not have streamlit installed, and by src/ui/app.py, which does. This mirrors the
existing src/core/settings.py / src/ui/app.py split (pure logic vs. widgets).
