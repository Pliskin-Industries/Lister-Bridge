# ISSUE_QUEUE.md — GitHub Issue Transit Queue

Issues queued here are created via `gh issue create` during a Housekeeping session.
After creation, record the assigned issue number and clear the entry.

**Disposition note — 2026-07-03 (Phase 6 hardening session):** the three issues
below — "eBay OAuth scopes in wrong format", "Token cache dead code", and
"Operator description edits silently discarded; condition field unvalidated" —
were implemented and verified (113/113 tests passing) in this execution
session. See `working/CODE_DECISIONS_PATCH.md` (C6-1/C6-2/C6-3) for the
decisions and `working/DOCUMENT_DRIFT_LOG.md` (2026-07-03 entry) for the
resulting doc drift. A Housekeeping session should create/close the
corresponding GitHub Issues (or close them directly if already open) rather
than filing them as new work, then clear these three entries.

## Issue: Frozen .exe loses SQLite state and image cache (relative paths anchor to %TEMP%)
**Labels:** bug, critical, packaging
**Milestone:** Phase 6 (hardening)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

`state_store.py:62` and `drive_fetcher.py:397` anchor relative `STATE_STORE_DB_PATH` / `DRIVE_CACHE_DIR` to `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent`. In the PyInstaller onefile build this resolves inside the `sys._MEIPASS` temp extraction dir, deleted on exit — dedup state and cache are lost every run, violating R-STATE (crash-and-resume never double-publishes). `.env` discovery via `load_dotenv()` is cwd-relative and has the same problem.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A single shared `resolve_app_path()` helper anchors relative paths to `%APPDATA%\ListerBridge` when `getattr(sys, "frozen", False)`, else project root (current behavior).
- [ ] Both `state_store.py` and `drive_fetcher.py` use the helper (dedup the two copies of anchoring logic).
- [ ] `.env` is loaded from the exe's directory and `%APPDATA%\ListerBridge` when frozen.
- [ ] Unit test with monkeypatched `sys.frozen` proves anchoring for both frozen and non-frozen cases.

## Issue: eBay OAuth scopes in wrong format — first live token refresh fails
**Labels:** bug, critical, api
**Milestone:** Phase 6 (hardening)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

`.env.example:49` sets `EBAY_OAUTH_SCOPES=sell.inventory commerce.media buy.browse`; eBay requires full scope URLs (e.g. `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.inventory`; Browse uses the base `api_scope`). `ebay_auth.py` sends the string verbatim → `invalid_scope`. Mocked tests only assert pass-through.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `.env.example` carries correct full-URL scopes for sandbox and production.
- [ ] `EbayAuth.__init__` raises a clear `ValueError` if any scope does not start with `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/`.
- [ ] Test covers the rejection path.

## Issue: Operator description edits silently discarded; condition field unvalidated
**Labels:** bug, high, ui
**Milestone:** Phase 6 (hardening)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

`app.py` renders an editable Description `st.text_area` but never reads it; `review.apply_operator_edits` (review.py:113) has no `description` parameter, so PI-004 defect-disclosure corrections are thrown away. eBay condition is a free-text input with no enum validation.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `apply_operator_edits` accepts `description`; `app.py` passes the text_area value through.
- [ ] Condition input replaced with `st.selectbox` over the canonical enum values from `orchestrator._CONDITION_MAP`.
- [ ] Tests in `test_review.py` cover description edit application.

## Issue: Orchestrator has no error handling; ItemStatus.ERROR never assigned
**Labels:** bug, high, core
**Milestone:** Phase 6 (hardening)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

`orchestrator.py` contains no try/except: one bad item (Gemini JSON `ValueError`, `DriveFetchError`) aborts the whole scan and discards completed work; `main()` prints a raw traceback, contradicting drive_fetcher's documented PI-001 contract. The stale-cache warning flag is discarded at `orchestrator.py:239`.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Per-batch try/except: failed batch recorded as `ItemStatus.ERROR` with a reason string; scan continues.
- [ ] Stale-cache warning surfaced on the payload/summary for UI display.
- [ ] `main()` catches top-level exceptions and prints a human-readable message, no raw traceback.
- [ ] Tests cover the continue-on-error path and error-status persistence.

## Issue: Token cache dead code — new eBay token minted per UI action
**Labels:** bug, high, api
**Milestone:** Phase 6 (hardening)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

`StateStore.get_cached_token`/`save_cached_token` have zero callers; `ebay_auth.py:19` references a `_TokenCache` that does not exist. `app.py` constructs a fresh `EbayClient()` in each button handler, so every Scan/Approve mints a new access token (defeats R-AUTH/R-COST).

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `EbayAuth` accepts an optional `StateStore` and reads/writes the cached token around `_refresh`.
- [ ] `app.py` holds one `EbayClient` (and one `StateStore`) in `st.session_state`.
- [ ] Stale docstring corrected (no phantom `_TokenCache`).
- [ ] Test proves a valid cached token skips the refresh call.

## Issue: archive_batch never called — batches never leave staging
**Labels:** bug, high, core
**Milestone:** Phase 6 (hardening)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

`drive_fetcher.archive_batch` (drive_fetcher.py:794) has zero callers. Every scan re-lists all historical batches; dedup rests entirely on the state store the frozen build currently deletes. Compounds into re-listing sold items.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `_auto_publish` archives the batch after the PUBLISHED state write succeeds; archive failure is logged, never blocks the publish result.
- [ ] Also catch `JSONDecodeError` in `_load_cache_manifest` (treat as cold cache per its own docstring).
- [ ] Integration test asserts archive is invoked post-publish.

## Issue: PyInstaller spec stale (PyInstaller 6 kwargs, wrong relative paths); two divergent build routes
**Labels:** bug, high, packaging
**Milestone:** Phase 6 (hardening)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

`packaging/lister_bridge.spec` uses `win_no_prefer_redirects`/`win_private_assemblies`/`cipher` (removed in PyInstaller 6.0, exactly what requirements-build.txt pins) and spec-relative paths that resolve to nonexistent `packaging/desktop_app.py`. `scripts/build_desktop.py` builds a different entry point. Two routes, different artifacts.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] One canonical build route producing a single .exe wrapping `desktop_app.py`; the other route removed or delegating to it.
- [ ] Spec uses `SPECPATH`-relative joins; PyInstaller-6-removed kwargs deleted; `googleapiclient` data files collected.
- [ ] Human gate: Alan builds and launches the .exe on Windows; scan + approve round-trip persists state across app restarts.

## Issue: Documentation drift — GraphQL/CLI references contradict REST + Streamlit implementation
**Labels:** docs, housekeeping
**Milestone:** Phase 6 (hardening)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

Per DOCUMENT_DRIFT_LOG entry 2026-06-27: README, ARCHITECTURE, CONSTRAINTS C-002, FMEA PI-009, KEY_DECISION_LOG DECISION 4, and the master plan still describe the GraphQL `startListingPreviewsCreation` path and/or a CLI interface. Code is REST Sell Inventory (createInventoryItem → createOffer → publishOffer) + Media API + Streamlit. Also: README directory tree lists `ebay_graphql.py`; CODE_DECISIONS_PATCH says "71 tests" (actual: 85+).

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All GraphQL/CLI references replaced with REST + Streamlit equivalents across the six documents.
- [ ] README directory tree matches the actual repo layout.
- [ ] Drift-log entry annotated as processed (pending human commit).
- [ ] `CODE_DECISION_LOG.md` merge NOT performed (human-gate action per Ground Rule 2).

## Issue: Prompt header Session 0.6 still instructs building ebay_graphql.py (GraphQL)
**Labels:** docs, high, housekeeping
**Milestone:** Phase 6 (hardening)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

`docs/lister-bridge-prompt-headers.md` (Session 0.6, ~lines 270-322) is a live, un-amended prompt header instructing a future execution session to build `src/api/ebay_graphql.py` against the 2026 GraphQL schema / `startListingPreviewsCreation`. CLAUDE.md's Execution-Session startup sequence loads headers from this exact file, so this is an operational hazard: a future AI session could faithfully build the wrong integration. Requires a substantive rewrite (REST Sell Inventory mapping, validation steps, acceptance criteria), not a find-and-replace — hence queued rather than patched during the 2026-07-03 doc-drift session.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Session 0.6 header rewritten for the REST path (createInventoryItem → createOffer → publishOffer + Media API) or marked SUPERSEDED with a pointer to the implemented `ebay_client.py`.
- [ ] No prompt header in the file instructs creation of `ebay_graphql.py`.

## Issue: SQLite thread-safety rationale is wrong; publish dedup is not atomic
**Labels:** bug, medium, core
**Milestone:** Phase 6 (hardening)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

`state_store.py` (~line 95) opens the connection with `check_same_thread=False`, commented "access is serialized by SQLite's own locking" — false: SQLite file locking serializes connections, not a single Python `sqlite3.Connection` shared across threads. Streamlit runs script executions on worker threads, and as of the 2026-07-03 hardening session `app.py` holds ONE StateStore/EbayClient in `st.session_state`, making cross-thread sharing the normal case. Separately, `_auto_publish` is check-then-act (`is_published()` → `publish()` → `upsert_item()`) with no claim step, so two concurrent approves of one SKU can both publish.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Connection access guarded (per-thread connections or a `threading.Lock` around all cursor use); the false comment corrected.
- [ ] WAL mode + `busy_timeout` enabled.
- [ ] Publish claims the SKU transactionally (e.g. write a PUBLISHING status row) before calling eBay; second concurrent approve becomes a dedup no-op.
- [ ] Concurrency test exercising two threads approving the same SKU.

## Issue: Guided credential setup wizard with per-credential validation
**Labels:** feature, high, ui
**Milestone:** Phase 7 (usability)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

New users must currently hand-author a `.env` from `.env.example` — the largest onboarding barrier for the packaged .exe. Add a Setup page to the Streamlit app: step-by-step credential entry for Google Drive (service-account JSON + folder IDs), Gemini (API key), and eBay (client ID/secret, refresh token, policies), each with a link to the issuing portal and a Test button that verifies the credential live. Facebook Marketplace and Mercari appear as no-credential draft platforms with links to their posting pages.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Validation + env-file read/write logic lives in a non-Streamlit module (testable without streamlit installed); the Streamlit page only renders.
- [ ] Test buttons: Drive → 1-item files.list on the staging folder; Gemini → cheap model call; eBay → token refresh via EbayAuth. Failures shown human-readable, never a traceback (PI-001 spirit).
- [ ] Saves to `%APPDATA%\ListerBridge\.env` when frozen, project `.env` otherwise (must match `load_app_dotenv` search order). Secrets masked in UI; never logged.
- [ ] App startup with missing required config lands on Setup with a banner instead of failing.
- [ ] Unit tests: env write/read round-trip, validators against fakes (success + failure), frozen/non-frozen target path.

## Issue: In-app tip sheet — sidebar contextual tips + Help tab
**Labels:** feature, medium, ui
**Milestone:** Phase 7 (usability)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

Operators have no in-app guidance on the workflow (Drive batch → Scan → review/edit → Approve → archive) or on what errors mean. Add short contextual hints beside the main controls and a Help tab containing the end-to-end workflow, field explanations, error/warning meanings (ItemStatus.ERROR reasons, stale-cache warning), where state lives, and the PI-004 defect-disclosure responsibility.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Help content lives as constants in a non-Streamlit module (testable; single source of truth).
- [ ] Sidebar/inline hints at: Scan button, condition selectbox, description editor, Approve button, error banners.
- [ ] Help tab covers: prerequisites, Drive folder conventions, scan→approve walkthrough, error meanings, state/cache locations (frozen vs dev), platform notes (eBay auto-publish vs FB/Mercari drafts).
- [ ] Test asserts help content covers all supported platforms from `other_adapter.supported_platforms()` plus eBay.

## Issue: Setup handholding Tier 1 — smart inputs and per-field walkthroughs
**Labels:** feature, high, ui, onboarding
**Milestone:** Phase 7 (usability)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

The wizard collects values but doesn't help obtain them. Lowest-effort/highest-value fixes: (a) Drive folder fields accept a pasted full Drive URL and extract the folder ID automatically; (b) after the service-account JSON is provided, surface the `client_email` from it with a copy button and the explicit instruction "share both Drive folders with this address" (the #1 silent Drive failure); (c) JSON path field validates existence/parseability on blur, not just at Test; (d) every field gets a "Where do I find this?" expander with numbered click-path instructions (portal → menu → button), maintained in `src/core/settings.py` schema so it stays testable; (e) a setup progress checklist at the top of the tab (per-service: not started / saved / test passed), persisted in the state store so it survives restarts.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Pasting a Drive folder URL into either folder field stores the bare ID; unit-tested parser in settings.py.
- [ ] Service-account email displayed with share instruction once JSON is valid.
- [ ] Per-field walkthrough text lives in the schema (non-Streamlit, tested for coverage of every required field).
- [ ] Progress checklist reflects saved + last-test-result per service across restarts.

## Issue: Setup handholding Tier 2 — fetch-and-pick for eBay policy IDs and location
**Labels:** feature, high, api, onboarding
**Milestone:** Phase 7 (usability)
**Depends on:** Tier 1
**Assignee:** ai-with-review

Users currently paste five opaque eBay IDs (fulfillment/payment/return policy, inventory location, default category). Once client ID/secret/refresh token validate, the wizard should fetch the user's actual business policies (Sell Account API `getFulfillmentPolicies` etc.) and inventory locations (`getInventoryLocations`) and present dropdowns instead of paste boxes. If none exist, link to the Seller Hub business-policies page with instructions. Fetch logic in a non-Streamlit module with injectable session, mirroring EbayAuth/EbayClient patterns.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "Fetch my policies" button populates dropdowns from live API; selection writes the IDs to settings.
- [ ] Empty-result path shows Seller Hub link + guidance, not an error.
- [ ] Unit tests with FakeSession for populated and empty responses.

## Issue: Setup handholding Tier 3 — guided eBay refresh-token minting
**Labels:** feature, high, api, onboarding, spike
**Milestone:** Phase 7 (usability)
**Depends on:** Tier 1
**Assignee:** human-gate

The refresh token is the single hardest credential: it requires an authorization-code consent flow with an eBay RuName redirect — not hand-authorable. Two candidate designs need a spike decision first: (A) in-app flow — wizard generates the consent URL from the user's client ID + RuName, opens the browser, user pastes back the resulting authorization code, wizard exchanges it for a refresh token and saves it; (B) fully local redirect capture on localhost (requires the user's RuName to be configured with a localhost-style accepted URL — verify eBay sandbox/production rules before committing). Spike must resolve: RuName registration steps, sandbox vs production differences, code-expiry handling (~5 min), and error UX. Per Ground Rule 7, this spike requires a linked formalization issue before Done.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Spike report comparing A/B with eBay's current redirect rules verified against live docs.
- [ ] Chosen design implemented: user completes consent in browser, wizard exchanges + saves the refresh token without hand-editing .env.
- [ ] Failure paths (expired code, wrong RuName, denied consent) render human-readable guidance.

## Issue: v2.0 planning — adopt closed-pricing-loop proposal and create session Issues
**Labels:** planning, housekeeping
**Milestone:** Phase 8 (v2.0)
**Depends on:** None
**Assignee:** human-gate

`docs/proposals/v2.0_closed_pricing_loop_and_roadmap.md` specs the v2.0 flagship (closed pricing loop: sale outcomes → pricing prior → Margin-Guard, human-gated reprice) plus the sequenced 2.0 roadmap. On adoption: create Issues for Sessions A–E per the proposal's §4 breakdown (Session A is a `spike` requiring a linked formalization issue per Ground Rule 7), and route the §3 FMEA amendment draft through the human gate before Sessions B–E execute.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Proposal reviewed and adopted/amended by Alan.
- [ ] Sessions A–E queued as Issues with the proposal as spec-of-record.
- [ ] FMEA amendment approved before any implementation session runs.

## Issue: [T-026] Add the manual paste AI provider core
**Labels:** feature, ai, onboarding
**Milestone:** Roadmap epic #7 (Phase 1b — Manual AI mode)
**Depends on:** #8 (T-003)
**Assignee:** GhengisPliskin
**Created 2026-09-10 as #10** (https://github.com/Pliskin-Industries/Lister-Bridge/issues/10) after owner approval of FMEA Amendment 6. Entry retained until the next Housekeeping reset.

# Objective

Add a subscription-chat AI route: Lister-Bridge renders a self-contained extraction packet per item, the operator pastes it (with the item photos) into any chat, and pastes the JSON reply back. The reply is verified against a deterministic packet ID and then parsed by the unchanged `vision_agent` path, so PI-004 and PI-005 hold without a Gemini API key.

Parent roadmap: #7. Design of record: `docs/proposals/v2.1_manual_paste_ai_provider.md`.

## Expected Files

- `src/ai/manual_provider.py`
- `src/core/orchestrator.py`
- `src/core/settings.py`
- `.env.example`
- `tests/test_manual_provider.py`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `build_packet` is deterministic over prompt, sorted photo names, and adapter version.
- [ ] `ManualProvider` implements `AIProvider`; stored reply returns stripped JSON, missing reply raises `ManualResponsePending`.
- [ ] Missing or mismatched packet ID is rejected before contract parsing (PI-014).
- [ ] `ScanSummary.pending` lists pending items with status `NEW`, completed on rescan.
- [ ] `AI_PROVIDER=manual` drops `GEMINI_API_KEY` from `missing_required`; module imports without streamlit or google-genai.

## Safety Boundary

- No clipboard or browser automation. No change to `src/contracts/`, state schema, publication, or pricing.
- Tests use fixture images and canned replies; no network, no credentials, no `%APPDATA%/ListerBridge`.

## Issue: [T-027] Render the manual paste workflow in the review UI
**Labels:** feature, ui, onboarding
**Milestone:** Roadmap epic #7 (Phase 1b — Manual AI mode)
**Depends on:** T-026 issue
**Assignee:** GhengisPliskin
**Created 2026-09-10 as #11** (https://github.com/Pliskin-Industries/Lister-Bridge/issues/11). Entry retained until the next Housekeeping reset.

# Objective

Surface the manual paste workflow in the Streamlit review UI: pending item cards with photos and paths, a copyable packet block, a paste area with fail-closed guidance, and a Help section. This is the owner's first operator UI test point.

Parent roadmap: #7. Design of record: `docs/proposals/v2.1_manual_paste_ai_provider.md`.

## Expected Files

- `src/ui/app.py`
- `src/ui/help_content.py`
- `src/ui/review.py`
- `tests/test_help_content.py`
- `tests/test_review.py`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Provider construction follows `AI_PROVIDER`; sidebar names the active mode.
- [ ] Pending cards show photos with paths, a copyable packet, and a paste area; "Use response" stores by packet ID and rescans.
- [ ] Mismatch and parse failures show human-readable guidance, no traceback, item stays pending.
- [ ] Help tab gains "Manual AI mode"; every new `TIPS` key is referenced in `app.py`.
- [ ] Owner smoke transcript recorded under `.team/evidence/T-027/`.

## Issue: State-store hardening follow-ups from the T-004 cycle-4 adversarial review
**Labels:** hardening, state, follow-up
**Milestone:** Roadmap epic #7 (apply during T-005, which owns the next `src/core/state_store.py` change)
**Depends on:** #9 (T-004, DONE)
**Assignee:** GhengisPliskin
**Queued:** 2026-09-10 from `.team/evidence/T-004/critic-cycle-4.md`. None of these blocked T-004; no code changed after the QA PASS.

# Objective

Close the operational concerns the cycle-4 critic confirmed without weakening the fail-closed migration behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] C-1: A persistently malformed legacy database does not accumulate one token-bearing backup per failed launch (either validate the legacy layout before snapshotting, or retain at most one backup per unchanged schema state). Update `test_malformed_or_missing_legacy_schema_fails_without_version_stamp` to the chosen rule.
- [ ] C-2: A constructor that times out waiting at `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` reports a lock timeout, not "migration failed and was rolled back".
- [ ] N-3: `_is_lock_contention` returns False when `sqlite_errorcode` is present and outside BUSY/LOCKED, instead of falling back to message matching.
- [ ] N-8: `_PATH_LOCKS` does not retain one lock per `:memory:` store URI.
- [ ] Plausible: `_create_backup` handles a UNC-hosted database path (or documents it as unsupported).

## Safety Boundary

Same as T-004: temporary databases and fake tokens only; no `%APPDATA%/ListerBridge`, `.env`, or credentials; publication claims remain T-005 scope.

## Issue: Manual provider hardening follow-ups from the T-026 review
**Labels:** hardening, ai
**Milestone:** Roadmap epic #7 (Phase 1b — Manual AI mode)
**Depends on:** #10 (T-026), #11 (T-027)
**Assignee:** GhengisPliskin
**Queued:** 2026-09-10 from `.team/evidence/T-026/qa.md` and `.team/evidence/T-026/critic.md`. Create when replies are persisted across sessions (T-006) or when a non-Drive photo source is added, whichever comes first.

# Objective

Close the accepted T-026 review concerns that fall outside T-027's UI scope.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The packet ID incorporates local file size and modified time (or a content digest) when the files exist, so a same-name or same-Drive-ID photo replacement invalidates stored replies (QA finding 1, critic F2).
- [ ] `parse_manual_response` rejects duplicate top-level `packet_id` keys via an `object_pairs_hook` (critic F3).
- [ ] The "strip so `extra=\"forbid\"` parses" docstring rationale is corrected to describe `extract_item`'s key-selective parsing (critic F5).
- [ ] `vision_agent.extract_item`'s docstring names `ManualResponsePending` as a propagated exception (critic F9).
- [ ] Pending rescans skip the `NEW` upsert and cache-hit downloads for items already recorded pending in the same session (critic F8), or the cost is documented as accepted.
